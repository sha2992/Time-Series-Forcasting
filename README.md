# Time-Series-Forcasting

Some time series forcasting work with pre existing Data in R. Work includes 
- Observing the compotents of the data
- Checking whether stationary or not
    - If not stationary then making it stationary
- Forecast with train-test data using different methods or algorithm (ex: ARIMA, AutoARIMA, ETS)
- Compare the models with their accuracy - error parameters
- Select the best model and make a final forecast
